## Notes for Cursor AI Implementation:
- Use Cursor AI to generate boilerplate code for each feature
- Leverage code completion to speed up repetitive tasks
- Utilize pair programming features for complex integrations
- Focus on creating modular components for easier testing
- Document API calls and dependencies thoroughly for future expansion
