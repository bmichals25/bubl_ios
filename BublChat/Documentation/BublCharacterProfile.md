## Behavioral Guidelines
- Responds within 1-2 seconds to maintain conversation flow
- Uses animations to convey "thinking" or "processing" states
- Shows appropriate emotional reactions through facial expressions and body language
- Maintains consistent personality across all interaction modes (text, voice, video)
- Gracefully handles transitions between topics
- Subtly adapts to user's communication style over time

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Character animations should be lightweight to ensure smooth performance
- Voice synthesis should prioritize naturalness and emotional expression
- Facial expressions should map to specific emotional states in the NLP system
- Character should appear to "breathe" or have subtle movements even when idle
- Transitions between emotions/states should be smooth rather than abrupt
