# BublChat Technical Stack Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the technical stack for BublChat, with primary focus on iOS development while ensuring future compatibility with web, Android, and Apple Vision Pro platforms. The architecture prioritizes modular design, cross-platform compatibility, and scalability.

## Core Technologies

### Frontend Development

| Platform | Primary Technology | Cross-Platform Considerations |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| iOS (Primary) | Swift with SwiftUI | Modular UI components with clear separation from business logic |
| Future Web | React.js | Shared business logic via API interfaces |
| Future Android | Kotlin | Shared API interfaces and backend services |
| Future Vision Pro | SwiftUI with visionOS SDK | Extended functionality from iOS codebase |

### Backend Services

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| API Layer | Node.js with Express | Lightweight, scalable REST API endpoints |
| Database | MongoDB | Flexible schema for conversation storage and user data |
| Authentication | Firebase Authentication | Cross-platform auth with easy social integration |
| Real-time Communication | WebRTC, Socket.io | Industry standard for video/audio streaming |
| Cloud Infrastructure | AWS or Google Cloud | Scalable infrastructure with global reach |

### AI & Animation Technologies

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Natural Language Processing | OpenAI GPT API or Anthropic API | Conversation intelligence |
| Speech Recognition | Whisper API or Google Speech-to-Text | Voice input processing |
| Text-to-Speech | Amazon Polly or Google WaveNet | Bubl's voice generation |
| Character Animation | Unity with AR Foundation | Cross-platform 3D character rendering |
| Computer Vision | Core ML (iOS) / TensorFlow Lite (Android) | Environment recognition |

```

### Cross-Platform Strategy

1. **Core Logic Sharing**
   - Abstract interfaces for all AI and backend services
   - Platform-agnostic conversation state management
   - Shared authentication and user profile handling

2. **Platform-Specific Implementations**
   - Native UI components for each platform
   - Platform-optimized media handling
   - Device-specific feature implementations

3. **Consistent API Interfaces**
   - RESTful API design for backend communications
   - WebSocket standards for real-time features
   - Documented service contracts between components

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: iOS Foundation
- Develop core modules in Swift with clear boundaries
- Implement API interfaces with future platform compatibility in mind
- Build character animation system using ARKit and SceneKit

### Phase 2: Modularization
- Extract platform-agnostic code into separate modules
- Create abstraction layers for AI/ML services
- Develop comprehensive API documentation

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Expansion
- Implement web interface using React.js
- Develop Android version using Kotlin
- Enhance iOS app for Vision Pro compatibility

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage Strategy
- Local caching for conversation history and character data
- Cloud synchronization for cross-device experience
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive user information

### Networking Requirements
- WebRTC optimization for low-latency video calls
- Bandwidth adaptation for varying connection quality
- Graceful degradation strategy (video → voice → text)

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient animation rendering for battery preservation
- Asynchronous AI processing to minimize UI blocking
- Asset streaming for reduced app size

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Tools | Focus Areas |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Unit Testing | XCTest (iOS), Jest (Web) | Core business logic, utilities |
| Integration Testing | Detox, Cypress | User flows, component interactions |
| Performance Testing | Instruments (iOS), Lighthouse (Web) | Rendering, network efficiency |
| Cross-Platform Testing | BrowserStack, Firebase Test Lab | Consistency across devices |

## Security Considerations

- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure API authorization with OAuth 2.0 and JWT
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- GDPR and CCPA compliance for user data

## Deployment Pipeline

1. CI/CD implementation using GitHub Actions
2. Automated testing before deployment
3. Staged rollout strategy for new features
4. Feature flagging for controlled release

## Monitoring & Analytics

- Application performance monitoring via New Relic or Datadog
- User engagement analytics through Firebase Analytics
- Error tracking and reporting with Sentry
- Conversation quality metrics for AI improvement
